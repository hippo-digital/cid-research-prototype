      <p>
        A living will (sometimes referred to as an advance decision) will allow you to record any medical treatments which you would like to refuse in the future if you lose the capacity to decide.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end it will generate a legal document about your wishes for treatment and care which you need to print, sign, witness and share.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to do everything all at once. At any point you can save what you’ve done and come back to it later.

          Advance Decisions are legally binding in England and Wales, as long as they meet certain requirements ({{ serviceName }} will help you meet these).

          Not quite. You need to print off your final documents, sign them and share them with people close to you and your doctor. If you’re making an Advance Decision to refuse life sustaining treatment you also have to get it witnessed. It’s not legally binding until you’ve done this.
