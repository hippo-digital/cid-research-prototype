        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Signing</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should sign and date your advance statement, but you do not need a witness.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">There is no legal requirement to sign an advance statement but it can help to show it is
          your wishes and that you have carefully considered them.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An advance statement is not legally binding. This means that the people caring for you do
          not have to follow the exact instructions in it,
          but they must use it as a guide when making decisions on your behalf.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing your form</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Once you have completed your advance statement you will need to share it widely so that it
          is known about and can be followed.</p>

        <details class="govuk-details">
          <summary class="govuk-details__summary"><span
              class="govuk-details__summary-text">Can I share a photocopy?</span></summary>
          <div class="govuk-details__text"><p class="govuk-body">Yes, the law says a photocopy is valid and can be used to inform any decision made about your care and treatment.</p></div>
        </details>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should share a copy with your:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>relatives</li>
          <li>close friends</li>
          <li>GP surgery</li>
          <li>anyone else involved in your care</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can make an appointment to discuss the form with your GP so that they understand your
          wishes. If you do not want to discuss it with your GP you should still make sure it is added to your medical
          record.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">It is a good idea to keep a copy with your other important documents, for example your
          living will or health power of attorney.</p>
