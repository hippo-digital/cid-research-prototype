        <p class="govuk-body">A terminal illness is an illness that cannot be cured and is likely to cause a person to
          die.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">There are many illnesses that can become terminal, including cancer, heart failure, kidney
          failure and lung disease.</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and</li>
          <li>you can no longer make or communicate a decision about your medical treatment, and</li>
          <li>you are unlikely to regain the ability to make these decisions, and</li>
          <li>you need a life-sustaining treatment to keep you alive</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Life-sustaining treatment includes but is not limited to CPR, clinically assisted
          nutrition and hydration, artificial or mechanical ventilation and antibiotics for life-threatening
          infections.</p>

          <div class="govuk-details__text"><h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What is life-sustaining treatment?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Life-sustaining treatment is any medical treatment that is intended to prolong or
              sustain
              your life. Here are some examples of life-sustaining treatment:</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">This is an emergency attempt to restart a person’s heart and/or breathing if they stop
              (called a cardiopulmonary arrest). CPR includes chest compressions (repeatedly pushing
              very firmly on the chest in an attempt to pump blood round the body), artificially inflating
              the lungs (by inserting a tube into the windpipe, by placing a mask over the mouth and nose,
              or by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) and defibrillation (using electric shocks to correct
              irregularities in the heart’s rhythm). In many cases CPR is not successful at restarting a
              person’s heart and breathing. If you have a long-term or chronic condition or a terminal
              illness then it is much less likely to be successful.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Mechanical or artificial ventilation</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Receiving mechanical or artificial ventilation means being put on a ventilator machine
              that
              helps you to breathe if you cannot do so on your own. Ventilators are also known as
              respirators or life-support machines.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Clinically assisted nutrition and hydration</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot swallow, you may be given a liquid that contains the nutrition or
              hydration that you need.
              This can be given through an intravenous drip (directly into a vein), a tube through the nose or a tube
              directly into the stomach (sometimes known as a PEG feed).</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Antibiotics</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Antibiotics can be a life-sustaining treatment if they are given for a
              life-threatening infection
              such as pneumonia. These types of infections are more common when someone is very ill, for example
              if they have advanced cancer or have had a stroke. Antibiotics can be given through an intravenous
              drip (directly into a vein) or by mouth as a tablet or liquid.</p></div>
        </details>
        <p class="govuk-body">This decision is only about life-sustaining treatment. This is not a refusal of pain
          relief or other
          treatments to keep you comfortable.</p>
